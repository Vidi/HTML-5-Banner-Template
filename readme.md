# Before you start, you will need:

- Node.js
- Grunt

# Steps

- Navigate into this folder (in the Terminal) and run 'npm install'
- Run 'grunt'
- This will start watching your CSS and JS for changes, then will recompile when it sees some

# Notes

- The banner jobs I generally get are 3-framed, this is why the DOM and styles are set-up for three frames. Change/remove this as you see fit.
